# Replication

This is a replication and extension of a study: Hangartner, D., Dinas, E., Marbach, M., Matakos, K., & Xefteris, D. (2019). Does Exposure to the Refugee Crisis Make Natives More Hostile? American Political Science Review, 113(2), 442-455. doi:10.1017/S0003055418000813

The figure replication code (replication.r) is credited to Mohamed, Sarah; Daponte-Smith, Noah; Rasband, Reed, 2019, "Replication Data for: Improving Treatment Comparability in an Instrumental Variables Design: Replication and Extension of Hangartner et. al 2018", https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/MGUYVO, Harvard Dataverse, V1, UNF:6:8aJ3EtVnIUgOyFiOaQVMxA== [fileUNF]

To use the figure replication code on our imputed data, one needs to modify the following: change the path to that of the the new csv file; change score names to reflect the way they are named in the new data (i.e., instead of scores_muslim we should have scores_muslim_pca or scores_muslim_tsne or scores_muslim_umap, depending on which method of dimensionality reduction we want to use now).
